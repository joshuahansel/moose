# ReferenceResidualConvergence

This object uses a reference residual for computing relative convergence criteria.
The `ReferenceResidualConvergence` object facilitates the assesment of convergence properties of MOOSE applications and allows extensions to provide the user more control over the application behaviour. This convergence object replaces [ReferenceResidualProblem.md], and as such the capabilities are similar to `ReferenceResidualProblem`.

## Description

See [ReferenceResidualProblem.md]. Similar input as the one used in the `[Problem]` block can now be prescribed in the `[Convergence]` block as below
